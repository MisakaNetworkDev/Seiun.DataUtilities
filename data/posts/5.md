Water resources are fundamental to national economic development. Over the years, China's Ministry of Water Resources, Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development, and National Development and Reform Commission have introduced various policies emphasizing water conservation.

China Water Week, observed from March 22 to 28, coincides with World Water Day and features extensive awareness campaigns. The 2025 China Water Week is themed "Promoting high-quality development in the water sector for national water security."

During the 14th Five-Year Plan period, China has been accelerating the development of smart water management. This approach integrates the internet of things, big data, cloud computing and artificial intelligence to enhance data collection, transmission, processing and service applications in water resource management.

By improving real-time monitoring, decision-making and emergency response, smart water solutions contribute to more efficient and sustainable water governance.

A notable example in 2024 is Shenzhen's digital drainage and water environment management platform. In response to increasing extreme weather events, this system enhances urban flood resilience and water quality, particularly in the Shenzhen River Basin, south China's Guangdong Province.

In Kunshan City, east China's Jiangsu Province, the smart drainage network management platform integrates big data visualization and real-time monitoring for efficient drainage operations. 

The project enhances digital management by conducting a citywide pipeline survey, standardizing data and establishing a unified database.

By deeply integrating the smart platform with operational workflows, it enables visible, controllable and intelligent management, driving innovation in urban drainage.

Across China, various promotional and educational activities during the 38th Water Week aim to raise public awareness of water conservation and sustainable resource management, fostering a culture of valuing and protecting water resources.

In southwest China's Yunnan Province, the Dai ethnic group's bamboo houses, also known as "ganlan" in Chinese, embody a unique architectural tradition. Built on stilts about two meters above the ground, these "ganlan" structures protect against dampness, pests, and flooding, adapting to the tropical rainforest climate. The upper level serves as living quarters, while the lower space is used for storage or livestock. Thatched roofs with steep slopes ensure efficient drainage, reflecting the Dai people's deep connection with nature.

Similarly, Cambodia's rural stilt houses, made primarily of wood, follow a design similar to the ganlan houses, which provide protection from floods and pests. Elevated on sturdy columns, they provide ventilation and thermal insulation. The main living areas, including the bedrooms and kitchens, occupy the upper level, and often feature a front veranda for daily activities.

Although from different cultural backgrounds, both the Dai bamboo houses and the Cambodian stilt houses demonstrate the ingenuity of traditional Asian architecture in adapting to the local environment.

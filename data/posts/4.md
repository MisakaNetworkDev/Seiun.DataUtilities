Edward Gaming, an esports club based in China, was crowned the global champion in shooter game Valorant, after beating Team Heretics 3:2 on Sunday in the grand final of the 2024 Valorant Champions Tour (VCT).

EDG sniper Zheng "ZmjjKK" Yangkang became the MVP of the grand final. He and his teammates will share a prize of $1 million.

ZmjjKK, or Kangkang, displayed an aggressive personality and achieved great performance under heavy pressure.

The grand final took place in South Korea's Inchon, where in 2008 Invictus Gaming (IG) became China's first world champion in League of Legends (LoL), a DotA-like game developed by Valorant's developer Riot Games.

EDG won their LoL world championship in 2021.
